          To start, click the <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> and download API packs
          that you're interested in.

          A short sample for the scala pack to get you started:

          <div class="readme-sample">scala Future andThen</div>

          Search queries consist of up to three components separated by spaces:
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Pack Name</li>
            <li>Path</li>
            <li>Member</li>
          </ol>

          The first is the only required component and identifies the
          documention pack that you are interested in. The second part matches
          on the path and the third one on the entity that your are looking for.

          The above example matches a method in Scala's API, where the full path
          is:
          <div class="readme-sample">scala.concurrent.Future</div>

          Give it a try!<br /><br />

          All three parts are regular expressions:

          <div class="readme-sample">sc utu.+ ^andThen$</div>

          This yields at least the same results as the first sample.

	  A pattern is automatically case insensitive if it contains no upper
	  case letter. For example the following matches at least the same as
	  the previous sample:

          <div class="readme-sample">sc utu.+ ^andthen$</div>

	</div>

  <div class="readme-column">
    You can use the following keys for navigation:

    <ul>
      <li><span class="readme-keys">/</span>This moves focus to the search
	field unless focus is in the documentation iframe.</li>
      <li><span class="readme-keys">shift + →</span>This selects the next
	search result to the right, if possible.</li>
      <li><span class="readme-keys">shift + ←</span>This selects the next
	search result to the right, if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    The documentation frame is the iframe element that is displaying this
    readme at the moment. This iframe is used to isolate the docs while
    the navigation and search remains available on top as a header.
